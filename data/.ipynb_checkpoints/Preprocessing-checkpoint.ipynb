But more recently, the carrots have come into view. Regulators have sent the message that the biggest banks can reduce the size of their required capital buffers by cutting down their size, complexity, and dependence on short-term funding.

Regulators have sent the message that the biggest banks can reduce the size of their required capital buffers by cutting down their size, complexity, and dependence on short-term funding. And the banks have responded.”   \n",

By early this month, Raymond James analystsuspected the deal was dead. When he asked about it on A-Power's third-quarter call, the company responded, via an interpreter, that GE had been unable to satisfy its design requirements. This \"defies logic,\" says Mr. Molchanov. Indeed, on Tuesday, A-Power retracted its statements and said it had \"no questions regarding the ability of GE to produce high-quality wind turbine gearboxes.\" For GE, that must be a load off.                                                        \n",

By early this month, Raymond James analystsuspected the deal was dead. When he asked about it on A-Power's third-quarter call, the company responded, via an interpreter, that GE had been unable to satisfy its design requirements. This \"defies logic,\" says Mr. Molchanov. Indeed, on Tuesday, A-Power retracted its statements and said it had \"no questions regarding the ability of GE to produce high-quality wind turbine gearboxes.\" For GE, that must be a load off.</td>\n",
